TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0 and sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT system_i/controller_system/inst/cpu_ctrl/cpu_clock_INST_0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/controller_system/inst/master_ctrl/cpu_reset_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/cpu_core/inst/register_file/registers_reg[7][25]/CLR,

 (the first 15 of 465 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RST relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CLK100MHZ, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on TX relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CLK100MHZ, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on RX relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CLK100MHZ, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin system_i/clk_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_system_clk_wiz_0_0, clkfbout_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin system_i/clk_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0, sys_clk_system_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>
